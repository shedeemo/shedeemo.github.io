			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>Hello! My name is Mohamed and I'm a Political Science PhD candidate at The Ohio State University with specializations in Comparative Politics and Research Methodology. I am proudly from Jersey City, NJ (<em>home to the Statue of Liberty btw</em>) but moved to Ohio for graduate school. As an undergraduate, I attended Seton Hall University, where I received my degree in International Relations and Economics and worked as a research assistant for the Center for Peace and Conflict Studies. </p>
            <p>My substantive interests currently revolve and public goods provision and how demographic factors and corruption result in unequal experiences of climate change for citizens of different social groups. I do this by studying the impact of the distribution of Jordan's tribes on both the enforcement of water sector reforms and the reliability of water delivery. Methodologically, I am interested in strategies of causal inference and the application of machine learning methods to political science as a means of data collection. As part of my dissertation, I am currently working on a more efficient means of estimating demographic distributions when accurate data is not publically available.</p>
